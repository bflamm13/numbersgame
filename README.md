# numbersgame

Playing around with java and OOD/OOP

using jersey to create restful apis for generating numbers for varous lottery games

Using spring to configure lottery games available

TO DO:

1) UI - to allow user to display lottery games, generated numbers, and add new games
2) DB - store games available and history of generated numbers(maybe for analytics)
3) refactor random number generates to decouple from lotterygame - just in case we want different generators
